## Control Plane Components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) when a deployment's `replicas` field is unsatisfied).

### kube-apiserver[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver)

The API server is a component of the Kubernetes [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane) that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-apiserver/). kube-apiserver is designed to scale horizontallyâ€”that is, it scales by deploying more instances. You can run several instances of kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.

### etcd[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd)

Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a [back up](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster) plan for the data.

You can find in-depth information about etcd in the official [documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/).

### kube-scheduler[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)

The Kubernetes scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods to Nodes. The scheduler determines which Nodes are valid placements for each Pod in the scheduling queue according to constraints and available resources. The scheduler then ranks each valid Node and binds the Pod to a suitable Node.

Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include: individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, and deadlines.

### kube-controller-manager[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)

Control plane component that runs [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) processes.

Logically, each [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.

Some types of these controllers are:

-   Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
-   Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
-   EndpointSlice controller: Populates EndpointSlice objects (to provide a link between Services and Pods).
-   ServiceAccount controller: Create default ServiceAccounts for new namespaces.

### cloud-controller-manager[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager)

A Kubernetes [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane) component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider. If you are running Kubernetes on your own premises, or in a learning environment inside your own PC, the cluster does not have a cloud controller manager.

As with the kube-controller-manager, the cloud-controller-manager combines several logically independent control loops into a single binary that you run as a single process. You can scale horizontally (run more than one copy) to improve performance or to help tolerate failures.

The following controllers can have cloud provider dependencies:

-   Node controller: For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
-   Route controller: For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
-   Service controller: For creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers

## Node Components[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#node-components)

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

### kubelet[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kubelet)

An agent that runs on each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in the cluster. It makes sure that [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) are running in a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

### kube-proxy[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)

kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) concept.

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.

### Container runtime[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime)

The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.

Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as Docker, [containerd](https://containerd.io/docs/), [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/#what-is-cri-o), and any other implementation of the [Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md).
